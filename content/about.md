Hi, I'm Derek. I'm a real jack of all trades, and a master of basically none of them. I am a software engineer, a card magician, a machinist, and a carpenter. Most of my time is spent programming. My favorite languages are Kotlin, Java, and Ruby.

Some of my hobbies include making electronics with things like Arduino, and speedsolving Rubik's cubes. I also enjoy playing good video games, and making shitty ones. You can see a few games I've made on my Itch.io page linked to the left. You can also find links to my gitlab and github accounts.
