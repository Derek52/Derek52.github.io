Hi, I'm Derek, and I'm a software engineer. At least, that's what I do professionally. On the side, I have worn many hats. I consider myself to be a jack of all trades, and a master of none. I live by the motto that a jack of all trades is better than a master of one.

If I could call myself a master of anything, it would be what I spend the most time on, which is software engineering. I am also a card magician, a certified machinist, and an amateur carpenter.

Some of my hobbies include woodworking, sewing, studying foreign langauges, making electronics with things like the Arduino platform, and speedsolving Rubik's cubes. I also enjoy playing good video games, and making shitty ones. You can see a few games I've made on my Itch.io page linked to the left. You can also find links to my gitlab and github accounts.

Some fun facts about me
* Code I have written has run on computers at CERN
* I am an ordained Minister
* I Have read Harry Potter in 3 languages
